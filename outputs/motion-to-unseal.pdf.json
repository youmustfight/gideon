  "document_summary": "The Department of Justice executed a search warrant on the premises of former President Donald J. Trump on August 5, 2022. The search warrant was issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida after finding probable cause. The Department provided notice to former President Trump's counsel of the execution of the search warrant. Former President Trump issued a public statement later that day acknowledging the execution of the search warrant. In the days since, the search warrant and related materials have been the subject of significant interest and attention from news media organizations and other entities. The government has requested that the Court unseal the Notice of Filing and its attachment (Docket Entry 17), which consists of the search warrant, signed and approved by the Court on August 5, 2022, including Attachments A and B; and the Property Receipt items seized pursuant to the search, filed with the Court on August 11, 2022. The government will respond to the direction of the Court to provide further briefing as to additional entries on the docket pursuant to the schedule set by the Court. Consistent with standard practice in this Court, the search warrant and attachments were each filed under seal in Case No. 22-mj-8332-BER to protect information related to the search; the Property Receipt was filed under seal because it lists items seized pursuant to the search. Former President Trump, through counsel, was provided copies of each of these documents on August 8, 2022, as part of the execution of the search. In these circumstances, the Court should unseal the search warrant, including Attachments A and B, and the Property Receipt, absent objection from the former President. In the case of Chicago Tribune Co. v.263 F.3d 1311, the court was asked to balance the interest in accessing court documents against the privacy interest of a party. The court considered factors such as whether allowing access would impair court functions or harm legitimate privacy interests, the degree and likelihood of injury if the information was made public, the reliability of the information, whether there will be an opportunity to respond to the information, whether the information concerns public officials or concerns, and the availability of a less intrusive alternative to sealing the documents.\n\nThe court found that, in this case, the factors favored unsealing the search warrant and its accompanying attachments. The warrant had already been executed and the former President had issued a public statement confirming the search. Furthermore, the press and the public had a First Amendment right of access to the criminal proceedings. This document is a motion by the United States to unseal a search warrant affidavit from the investigation into former President Donald Trump. The government argues that there is a public interest in understanding what occurred during the investigation, particularly given that it involved the search of property belonging to the 45th President of the United States. The government also notes that Trump himself has not objected to the unsealing of the affidavit. A proposed order is attached.",
