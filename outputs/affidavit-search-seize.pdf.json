  "document_summary": "In February of 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) discovered classified information mixed in with other materials in 15 boxes that had been transferred from former President Trump's possession. NARA staff contacted the Department of Justice (DOJ), which opened a criminal investigation.\n\nThe FBI's investigation has established that documents bearing classification markings, which appear to contain National Defense Information (NDI), were among the materials contained in the fifteen boxes and were stored at Trump's Palm Beach, Florida property in an unauthorized location. There is also probable cause to believe that additional documents that contain classified NDI or that are Presidential records subject to record retention requirements currently remain at the premises.\n\nIn an affidavit, the Special Agent with the FBI assigned to the Washington Field Office details their experience and training in counterintelligence and espionage investigations, and how this experience has led them to believe that there is probable cause to search the premises known as 1100 Ocean Blvd, Palm Beach, FL 33480 for evidence of illegal activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. SS 793(e), 1519, or 2071.\n\nThe Special Agent outlines the evidence they have gathered during the course of the investigation, which includes information from other FBI and U.S. Government personnel. This evidence indicates that there is a likelihood that the premises in question contain evidence of illegal activity related to the national defense, which could be used to injure the United States or advantage a foreign nation.\n\nBased on this evidence, the Special Agent concludes that there is probable cause to believe that a search of the premises would uncover evidence of illegal activity.\n\nIn May of 2021, the National Archives made a request for fifteen boxes of presidential records that had been transported from the White House to Trump Tower. The request was made after the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the improper storage and handling of classified information by former President Trump.\n\nIn January 2021, at least two moving trucks were observed at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and it is believed that fifteen boxes of presidential records were transported from the White House to Trump Tower. The National Archives made a request for the missing records on or around May 6, 2021, and continued to make requests until approximately late December 2021, when they were informed that twelve of the boxes had been found and were ready for retrieval at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn May of 2022, FBI agents conducted a preliminary review of the 15 boxes of documents and The warrant in this case covers the search of premises and seizure of property related to an investigation into possible violations of espionage and record-keeping laws. The premises to be searched include the \"45 Office\" used by former President Donald Trump and his staff, as well as all storage rooms and other areas on the property where boxes or documents could be stored. The warrant does not include areas currently occupied, rented, or used by third parties, such as at Mar-a-Largo. The property to be seized includes all physical documents and records constituting evidence of the potential violations being investigated. The National Archives and Records Administration is responsible for the preservation and management of government records, and has established the Presidential Records Act to provide guidance on the management of Presidential records. Presidential records are defined as records created or received by the President, his/her immediate staff, or a Presidential appointee in the course of conducting official business, and include records that document the activities of the President or his staff.",

Specifically, the letter stated in relevant part: As Ipreviously indicated fo you; Mar-a-Lago does not include a secure location authorized for the storage of classified informnation As such,it appears that since the time classified documents] were reinoved ffon the secure facilities at the White House and moved to Mar-a-Lago O 0T around January 20, 2021, they have not been handled in an appropriate mlalner O stored in an appropriate location   Accordingly, we ask that the room at Mar-a-Lago where the documents had been stored be secured aud that all of the boxes that were moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago (along with any other items in that room) be preserved in that IOO1l in their curent condition until fiuther notice. 18 U.S.C. $ 793(e) does not use the tern \"classified information but rather crimiualizes the unlawful retention of \"infonnation relating to the national defense: The statute does uot define ~infornation related to the national defense; but courts have coustrued it broadly.

As described above, evideuce of the SUBJECT OFFENSES has been stored i multiple locations at the PREMISES. 0 Accordingly, this affidavit seeks authorization to search the \"45 Office\" and all storage rooms and 29 Case 9.22-mj-08332-BER Document 102-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/26/2022 Page 30 of 38 any other rooms or locations where boxes Or records may be stored within the PREMISES , as further described in Attachment A The PREMISES is currently closed to club members for the summer; however; as specified in Attachment ^, if at the time of the search, there are areas of the PREMISES being occupied, rented, or used by third parties, and not otherwise used or available to be used by FPOTUS and his staff; the search would not include such areas_ CONCLUSION 79.

Further, I submit that this affidavit supports probable cause for a warrant to search the PREMISES described in Attachment and seize the items described in Attachment B. REQUEST FOR SEALING 80. It is respectfully requested that this Court issue an order sealing, until further order of the Court, all papers submitted in support of this application, including the application and search warrant: I believe that sealing this document is necessary because the items and information to be seized are relevant to an ongoing investigation and the FBI has not yet identified all potential criminal confederates nor located all evidence related to its investigation.

Bratt, Esquire Chief Counterintelligence Export Control Section National Security Division U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania, Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20530 Re: Presidential Records Investigation Dear write on behalf of President Donald J. Trump regarding the above-referenced matter: Public trust in the government is low. At such times, adherence to the rules and long-standing policies is essential. President   Donald J. Trump is a leader of the Republican  Party. The Department of Justice (DOJ), as part of the Executive Branch, is under the control of a President from the opposite party. It is critical, given that dynamic, that every effort is made to ensure that actions by DOJ that may touch upon the former President; or his close associates; do not involve politics There have been   public   reports about an investigation   by DOJ into Presidential Records purportedly marked as classified  among materials that were once in the White House and unknowingly included among the boxes brought to Mar-a-Lago by the movers. It is important to emphasize that when a request was made for the documents by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), President Trump readily and voluntarily to their transfer to NARA: The communications regarding the transfer of boxes to NARA were friendly, open, and straightforward. President Trump voluntarily ordered that the boxes be provided to NARA No legal objection was asserted about the transfer. No concerns were raised about the contents of the boxes. It was a voluntary and open process_ Unfortunately, the faith demonstrated by President Trump was not matched once the boxes arrived at NARA. Leaks followed And, once DOJ got involved, the leaks continued. Leaks about any investigation are concerning: Leaks about an investigation that involve the residence of a former President who is still active on the national political scene are particularly troubling: Jay: agreed good Case 9.22-mj-08332-BER Document 102-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/26/2022 Page 35 of 38 I. Bratt May 25, 2022 Page 2 of 3 It is important to note a few bedrock principles: (1) President Has Absolute Authority To Declassify Documents. Under the U.S. Constitution, the President is vested with the highest level of authority when it comes to the classification and declassification of documents. See U.S. Const , Art. II, $ 2 ( The President  [is] Commander in Chief of the and Navy of the United States[:]\"). His constitutionally-based authority regarding the classification and declassification of documents is unfettered. See Navy V Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988) ( [The President's] authority to classify and  control access to information bearing on national security flows primarily from this constitutional  investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant \") (2) Presidential Actions Involving Classified Documents Are Not Subject To Criminal Sanction: attempt to impose criminal liability on a President or former President that involves his actions with respect to documents marked classified would implicate grave constitutional separation-of- powers issues. Beyond that; the primary criminal statute that governs the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material does not to the President  That statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Whoever; an officer; employee, contractor; or consultant of the United States, and, by virtue ofhis office, employment; position; or contract, becomes possessed of documents or materials containing classified information of the United States, knowingly removes such documents or materials without authority and with the intent to retain  such documents or materials at an unauthorized location shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both: 18 U.S.C. $ 1924(a). An element of this offense, which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt; is that the accused is an officer; employee, contractor; or consultant of the United States. The President is none of these. See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd , 561 U.S. 477, 497-98 (2010) (citing U.S. Const , Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2) ( The people do not vote for the Officers of the United States. '); see also Melcher v. Fed Open Mkt. Comm , 644 F. 510,518-19 (DDC. 1986), aff\"d,836 F.2d 561 (D.C. Cir.

See htps:Iloig justice_gov/reports/top-_nanagemnent-and-performance-challenges- facing-department-justice-202L (last visited May 25,2022). We request that DOJ adhere to long- standing policies and procedures regarding communications between DOJ and the White House regarding pending investigative matters which are designed to prevent political influence in DOJ decision-making: DOJ Must Be Candid With Judges And Present Exculpatory Evidence: Long-standing DOJ policy requires that DOJ attorneys be candid in representations made to judges. Pursuant to those policies, we request that DOJ provide this letter to any judicial officer who is asked to rule on any motion pertaining to this investigation; or on any application made in connection with any investigative request concerning this investigation: The official policy of DOJ further requires that prosecutors present exculpatory evidence to a jury. Pursuant to that policy, we request that DOJ provide this letter to any grand jury considering evidence in connection with this matter; or any jury asked to issue a subpoena for testimony or documents in connection with this matter.

Bratt, Esquire Chief Counterintelligence Export Control Section National Security Division U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania, Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20530 Re: Presidential Records Investigation Dear write on behalf of President Donald J. Trump regarding the above-referenced matter: Public trust in the government is low. At such times, adherence to the rules and long-standing policies is essential. President   Donald J. Trump is a leader of the Republican  Party. The Department of Justice (DOJ), as part of the Executive Branch, is under the control of a President from the opposite party. It is critical, given that dynamic, that every effort is made to ensure that actions by DOJ that may touch upon the former President; or his close associates; do not involve politics There have been   public   reports about an investigation   by DOJ into Presidential Records purportedly marked as classified  among materials that were once in the White House and unknowingly included among the boxes brought to Mar-a-Lago by the movers. It is important to emphasize that when a request was made for the documents by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), President Trump readily and voluntarily to their transfer to NARA: The communications regarding the transfer of boxes to NARA were friendly, open, and straightforward. President Trump voluntarily ordered that the boxes be provided to NARA No legal objection was asserted about the transfer. No concerns were raised about the contents of the boxes. It was a voluntary and open process_ Unfortunately, the faith demonstrated by President Trump was not matched once the boxes arrived at NARA. Leaks followed And, once DOJ got involved, the leaks continued. Leaks about any investigation are concerning: Leaks about an investigation that involve the residence of a former President who is still active on the national political scene are particularly troubling: Jay: agreed good",

Bratt May 25, 2022 Page 2 of 3 It is important to note a few bedrock principles: (1) President Has Absolute Authority To Declassify Documents. Under the U.S. Constitution, the President is vested with the highest level of authority when it comes to the classification and declassification of documents. See U.S. Const , Art. II, $ 2 ( The President  [is] Commander in Chief of the and Navy of the United States[:]\"). His constitutionally-based authority regarding the classification and declassification of documents is unfettered. See Navy V Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988) ( [The President's] authority to classify and  control access to information bearing on national security flows primarily from this constitutional  investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant \") (2) Presidential Actions Involving Classified Documents Are Not Subject To Criminal Sanction: attempt to impose criminal liability on a President or former President that involves his actions with respect to documents marked classified would implicate grave constitutional separation-of- powers issues. Beyond that; the primary criminal statute that governs the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material does not to the President  That statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Whoever; an officer; employee, contractor; or consultant of the United States, and, by virtue ofhis office, employment; position; or contract, becomes possessed of documents or materials containing classified information of the United States, knowingly removes such documents or materials without authority and with the intent to retain  such documents or materials at an unauthorized location shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both: 18 U.S.C. $ 1924(a). An element of this offense, which the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt; is that the accused is an officer; employee, contractor; or consultant of the United States. The President is none of these. See Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd , 561 U.S. 477, 497-98 (2010) (citing U.S. Const , Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2) ( The people do not vote for the Officers of the United States. '); see also Melcher v. Fed Open Mkt. Comm , 644 F. 510,518-19 (DDC. 1986), aff\"d,836 F.2d 561 (D.C. Cir.

We request that DOJ adhere to long- standing policies and procedures regarding communications between DOJ and the White House regarding pending investigative matters which are designed to prevent political influence in DOJ decision-making: DOJ Must Be Candid With Judges And Present Exculpatory Evidence: Long-standing DOJ policy requires that DOJ attorneys be candid in representations made to judges. Pursuant to those policies, we request that DOJ provide this letter to any judicial officer who is asked to rule on any motion pertaining to this investigation; or on any application made in connection with any investigative request concerning this investigation: The official policy of DOJ further requires that prosecutors present exculpatory evidence to a jury. Pursuant to that policy, we request that DOJ provide this letter to any grand jury considering evidence in connection with this matter; or any jury asked to issue a subpoena for testimony or documents in connection with this matter.
