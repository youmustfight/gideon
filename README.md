### What is this?

- An attempt at AI-first legal tooling.
- Frontend companion (treat it as a sidebar) runs at port `1111`.
- Backend API file parser + ai functions run at port `3000`
- Postgres DB running at port `5432`

### Run it Locally

1. Create a file in the root of this repo called `.env`, and copy values from the gist, notion page, or whever it's being stored atm.
2. Spin up the frontend/backend from the root of this repo with `docker-compose up` (when api requirements change, rebuild the api with `docker-compose build api`)
3. Once running, go to directory `databases/app` and run migrations with `alembic upgrade head`
4. Then from the same directory, seed the database with a user/case via `python seed.py`
5. You're good to go! Just go to `localhost:7000`, click through the login/case views, and start uploading files + querying!
